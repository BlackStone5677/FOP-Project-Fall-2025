# ⚽ Soccer Engine

Welcome to the **Soccer Engine AI Challenge**! This is a lightweight, SDL2-based soccer simulation designed for students and developers to practice low-level C programming, game engine architecture, and autonomous agent logic.

## 📌 Project Overview

The engine simulates a 6v6 soccer match. The core physics, rendering, and entity management are provided. Your task is to act as the **Referee** (Phase 1) and the **Coach** (Phase 2).

### Tech Stack

* **Language:** C (C99)
* **Graphics:** SDL2, SDL_ttf, SDL_image
* **Physics:** Custom 2D vector-based kinematics
